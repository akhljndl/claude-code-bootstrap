# claude-code-bootstrap

A Claude-driven bootstrap for your Claude Code setup. Clone it, open Claude Code, say **"bootstrap me"**, and Claude interviews you then generates your personalized configuration.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhljndl/claude-code-bootstrap.git
cd claude-code-bootstrap
claude
# Then say: "bootstrap me"
```

## What You Get

1. **`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** — A personalized global instructions file tuned to your workflow preferences (agent behavior, task lifecycle strictness, pain point adjustments).

2. **PostToolUse hooks** in `~/.claude/settings.json` — Auto-formatting and lint checks that run after every edit:
   - **Python:** `ruff format` + `ruff check --fix`, `print()` warnings
   - **Go:** `goimports` formatting, `go vet` static analysis
   - **TypeScript:** Prettier formatting, `tsc` type checking, `console.log` warnings (skipped if ECC plugin provides them)

3. **Missing tool installation** — Detects and offers to install: `ruff`, `mypy`, `goimports`, `staticcheck`, `prettier`, `typescript`.

## The Interview

| # | Question | Default |
|---|----------|---------|
| 0 | Quick start or full interview? | — |
| 1 | Agent behavior: proactive / confirm-first / always-confirm | confirm-first |
| 2 | Working docs cleanup: ephemeral / persistent / selective | selective |
| 3 | Primary languages (multi-select) | auto-detected |
| 4 | Pain points: too passive / too verbose / missing workflow / too aggressive | missing workflow |
| 5 | Post-work reviews: auto-run / confirm | auto-run |
| 6 | Doc-updater: auto / manual | auto |
| 7 | Project types: fullstack / CLI / data-ML / mix | mix |
| 8 | Task lifecycle: strict / guidelines / loose | guidelines |

Say **"quick start"** to skip the interview and accept all defaults.

## Philosophy

- **Opinionated defaults, fully overridable.** The defaults reflect a workflow that emphasizes structure without ceremony. Every choice can be changed.
- **Claude IS the script.** No shell scripts, no installers. The `CLAUDE.md` in this repo instructs Claude Code to run the entire bootstrap interactively.
- **Non-destructive.** Re-running is safe. Existing hooks are merged (deduped by description). Existing settings are preserved. A marker in the generated CLAUDE.md enables re-run detection.

## Works With ECC

This bootstrap works alongside the [everything-claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/everything-claude-code) plugin but doesn't require it.

- **ECC installed:** TypeScript hooks are skipped (ECC provides them). Agent table references ECC agents directly.
- **ECC not installed:** All hooks are generated. Agent table notes that agents are available if ECC is installed later.

## Re-Running

Safe to re-run at any time. The bootstrap detects the `<!-- Generated by claude-code-bootstrap -->` marker and offers:
- **Start fresh** — regenerate everything
- **Update sections** — re-run interview for specific parts
- **Just check tools** — verify tool installations only

## What's NOT in Scope (v1)

- **Rules files** — Let ECC or other plugins handle language-specific rules.
- **Per-project CLAUDE.md** — This generates the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` only.
- **Shell scripts** — Claude is the automation layer.
